One of the more advanced methods of steganography with JPEGs currently is the F5 algorithm
https://github.com/jackfengji/f5-steganography

will need to guess that the password is: flag
(passwords are required for F5)

decode:
python utity.py -t x -i ./tests/F5.jpg -p flag

flag{uncover-F5-steganography}
